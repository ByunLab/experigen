# experiGEN

A framework for creating phonology experiments.

A linguist should be able to clone this, and easily set up your own experiment without any server-side code! (i.e. run this on your personal website.) You need to know a minimal amount of JavaScript, and perhaps some HTML and even CSS.

## Setup

* app
  - custom.css
  - scripts
    - Where the linguist specifies how the experiment works 
  - templates
    - Where the linguist specifies what the experiment looks like
* data
  - items.txt (saved from spreadsheet)
  - pictures
  - sounds
* index.html
* lib
  - Here be dragons!

## TODO

* Documentation
* Examples
* What the linguist needs to learn
* Michael:
  - Make it work again! (done?)
  - Replace getItems, getUserCode, getFrames with JavaScript versions
* Jon:
  - Couch?
  - Sammy
